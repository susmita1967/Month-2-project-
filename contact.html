                Each Piece Is Different, So We Recommend Looking At The Care Instructions On The Label Of Your Piece
                Before Washing. All Of Our Pieces Are "Machine Cold Wash" Which Saves Over 2,000 Pounds Of CO2 Per Year
                Vs. Washing In Hot Water-Every Little Bit Counts, And We Strongly Believe In Doing Our Part. We Advise A
                Temperature Of 30 Degrees Celsius / 85 Fahrenheit Or Lower When Washing.
                <br><br>
                Please Do Not Tumble Dry. Tumble Drying Reverses The Bonding Process Used In Many Of Our Pieces,
                Reheating The Glue Which Will Cause The Seams Of Your Piece To Break. It Can Also Reduce The Lifespan Of
                Products As The Tumbling Action Is Rough, Causing Fibers To Break And Elastic To Warp. As A General
                Rule, Please Don't Use Fabric Softener-It Can Damage The Performance Properties Of Our Fabrics.
